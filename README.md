Suicide among adolescents represents a critical global public health challenge. This study proposes a novel multimodal framework for speech and text fusion and secondary reasoning by DeepSeek. Utilizing the SpeechWellness Challenge (SW1) dataset, our experimental design encompasses three speech tasks: Emotion Regulation, Paragraph Reading, and Expression Description. The framework processes speech data through a wav2vec 2.0 + BiLSTM architecture, incorporates the FunASR framework for speech transcription, and leverages the Qwen model for risk assessment and secondary reasoning. A psychological scoring system with confidence evaluation was specifically designed for multi-task risk quantification. Experimental results demonstrated that our multimodal fusion approach with Qwen model achieves a final assessment accuracy of 0.68. The results suggested that incorporating risk assessment knowledge and adding secondary reasoning could significantly enhance interpretability in adolescent suicide risk evaluation.
